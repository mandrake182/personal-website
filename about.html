										<h2>Early years</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I was born in a small town in Mexico called Zitacuaro in Michoacan. I lived there for just one year because my parents decided to move to Ciudad de Mexico to find better work opportunities. I attended junior and elementary school in the city and I started to get interested in video games and drawing. 
									</p>
									<p>When I was 12 we had to move to Estado de Mexico given that my father got a promotion but the job had to be done out of the city. In this new place, I attended middle school and I developed a big interest in basketball and dancing but my interest in video games hasn't disappeared.
										When I was 14 I discovered the music and this captured my attention i wanted to learn how to play guitar and live the Rockstar dream hahaha. So I took guitar lessons and bought my first electric guitar at the beginning I was really into punk and pop-punk rock music after a couple of years I got interested in classic rock. At the same time, I took a short career on Desing and Operation of personal computers in this course I discovered the programming and the basis of web development and I realized that I wanted to study something related to animation, web page creation, and programming.

												<h3>High School and University</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Once my middle education was completed, I had to attend High school I found a school that offered a program that included the reglementary high school grade but at the same time, a technical specialty in accountability assisted by computer, this, was because I got interested in computers since I was attending the other career in Computer's Operation.
												When my first year of high school finished, I completed a career in Computer Operations and by this time I was capable of creating small websites and a good domain of software for design.												
											</p>
											<p>For my professional education I decided to study Computer science engineering so here I learned all the things I was interested in since I was a teenager. During this period in my free time, I started to sell my first websites for local businesses and get real experience in the field, it was a difficult but exciting time in my life since my family was struggling with money.</p>
